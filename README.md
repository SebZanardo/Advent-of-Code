# Advent-of-Code
### My Advent of Code solutions which all produce correct answers.  
Input files have been removed from the repository for all questions as they are property of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), so you will have to create your own `input.txt` file containing your _unique input_ for the question.

<sub>
 Note: Some solutions might not be the most optimal for time or space complexity. I have tried to comment the code to explain my thought process and give pointers at better solutions to some problems when I did not implement the most efficient approach.
